The proposed project aims to develop, implement and validate new algorithms for biomedical signal processing and classification, focusing especially on ECG signals, using methods emerging from the theory of sparse coding.

Sparse coding is a promising tool in signal processing, and consists of representing data using a small set of signals from a fixed or adaptive overcomplete dictionary. These compact representations can be exploited in various applications for more efficient acquisition, processing, or serve as features for signal classification. The literature on sparse coding and its applications, especially compressed sensing, is extensive, and there have been many algorithm developed for common tasks like coding and dictionary learning

For ECG signal processing, sparse coding is a promising approach for some emerging application with strict efficiency and accuracy requirements, e.g. wearable medical devices for long-term ECG monitoring, for monitoring driver state for increased automotive safety, and for person identification based on ECG biometric traits. Sparse coding theory is well positioned as a solution for these technical challenges, due to its inherent efficiency in representation and the possibility of learning dictionaries of characteristic features.

The main objectives of the project are to design, implement and evaluate solutions for identifying different pathologies of the heart and for person identification, based on sparse coding of ECG data with dictionaries of characteristic features. The algorithms will be integrated in an open-source software library. The dissemination of the results will be done via publishing in indexed journals and high-quality conferences. The project is planned for 24 months.
