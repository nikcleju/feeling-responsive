## Objectives

The main topic of the project is using sparse coding techniques for enhanced processing and classification of medical signals, focusing especially on ECG signals. This involves working along
two directions: (i) design good dictionaries for sparse and accurate representation of the data, and (ii) develop algorithms which rely on the sparse representations for improved signal processing tasks, e.g. segmentation, denoising or classification of the data. To this end, we define the following particular objectives:

* **O1**. Perform review of the state-of-the-art sparse representation models and applications used in medical signal processing, and especially for processing ECG signals
* **O2**. Design, implement and evaluate a solution for identifying different pathologies of the heart, based on ECG sparse coding using dictionaries of discriminative features
* **O3**. Design, implement and evaluate a solution for person identification using ECG sparse coding with dictionaries of biometrical traits extracted from the ECG signal acquired from chest, finger or hand palm 
* **O4**. Investigate extensions of the current sparse models: use alternative sparse models, joint analysis of multi-channel ECG signals, or fusing signals acquired from multiple sensors
* **O5**. Integrate the developed algorithms into an open-source software library and publish it online
* **O6**. Disseminate the research results through papers at international conferences and JCR indexed journals
